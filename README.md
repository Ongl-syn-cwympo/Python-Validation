# Data Validation ~ validation (is it valid and logical?) 

To ensure that the data being processed is accurate it must be checked to see that it makes sense. It is asking too much of a computer to check if it's true 
somebody may just be lying! Certain validation checks can be carried out:

# Types of validation

- Range-check e.g. a driver's age should be between 17 and 99

- Type-check e.g. a name should only contain alphabetic characters

- Format-check e.g. a data should be entered as dd/mm/yyyy

- Presence-check e.g. certain data must be entered (e-mail address)

- Checksum e.g. the numeric values in a file should always add up to a known amount

- Check-digit e.g. the last digit of an account number is calculated from the previous digits, and then recalculated on input to see if it matches

# Why do we have to have/use a validation type

Data validation is an essential part of any data handling task whether you’re in the field collecting information, analyzing data, or preparing to present data 
to stakeholders. If data isn’t accurate from the start, your results definitely won’t be accurate either. That’s why it’s necessary to verify and validate data 
before it is used. Overall, validating the accuracy, clarity, and details of data is necessary to mitigate any project defects.
